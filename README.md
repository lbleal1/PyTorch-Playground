# PyTorch Playground

This will cover my code experiments, recipes, and helpful resources for PyTorch.


## Resources
-----
Basic PyTorch 
* Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn (Sebastian Rashcka et al)
  * covers fundamentals of PyTorch (intro, common workflows)
  * working with models created from scratch (nn.Sequential and subclassing nn.Module)
  * **highlights:** lightning API, tensorboard 

By Topic
* Loading Local Data and Fine-tuning Pre-trained Models
  * [Chap6 of Zero to Mastery Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning (Daniel Bourke)](https://www.learnpytorch.io/06_pytorch_transfer_learning/)

-----
Advanced PyTorch
* Deep Learning with PyTorch (Eli Stevens et al)


By Topic
* Ablations, Accessing and Modifying Different Layers of a Pretrained Model in PyTorch
  * [ConvNets - Accessing and Modifying Different Layers of a Pretrained Model in PyTorch by Morteza Mohammady Gharasuie](https://github.com/mortezamg63/Accessing-and-modifying-different-layers-of-a-pretrained-model-in-pytorch/blob/master/README.md)
